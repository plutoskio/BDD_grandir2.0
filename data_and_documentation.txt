You have been provided with two primary datasets in Excel format.

File A: Liste des candidatures (The Demand)
What it is: A log of every application received. Each row represents one candidate applying to one specific job opening.
Key Variables:
Référence de l’annonce: The "Foreign Key" used to link this application to the specific job opening in File B.
Date: Date of application (critical for calculating "Time-to-Hire" or process bottlenecks).
Statut / Etape: The current status of the application (e.g., "Candidature", "Refus", "Entretien"). Analyzing where candidates drop off here is key for Track B1.
Ville du candidat / Code postal: The candidate's location. Essential for B2 students to calculate commute distances.
Diplôme... / Titulaire du diplôme...: Various columns indicating the candidate's self-declared qualifications.
Challenge: This data is often incomplete or messy (e.g., "CAP Petite Enfance" might appear in different text formats). You will likely need to cross-reference this with the PDF analysis to confirm true "CAT 1" or "CAT 2" status.
Prénom / Nom / Email: Empty. These have been anonymized for privacy.
File B: Liste des annonces (The Supply)
What it is: A list of all open positions (vacancies) in the Grandir network.
Key Variables:
Référence: The unique ID of the job opening. Use this to join with File A.
CAT: CRITICAL. This indicates the regulatory category of the job (CAT 1, CAT 2, or CAT 3).
Context: A "CAT 1" job (e.g., Auxiliaire de Puériculture) requires a specific state diploma. A "CAT 2" job allows for different qualifications. Your matching engine must ensure candidates have the right diploma for the right CAT, and, this can be tricky.
Quelle est la couleur de la crèche ?: CRITICAL. This represents the Urgency Score:
🔴 Rouge: Critical urgency. High vacancy rate. Needs immediate matching.
🟠 Orange: High urgency.
🟢 Verte: Normal urgency.
Strategy: in your solution, you must prioritize filling "Rouge" roles first.
Localisation: The full address of the kindergarten. Use this for geolocation.
Total candidatures reçues vs A TRAITER: Metrics showing the backlog for each specific job.
Google Maps sharing list (The Locations)


Source: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1atzr9igxw23EPPm6FQtOSGKWSAnHtNo&ll=42.465286513735066%2C-4.759829973885141&z=6
The client provided this link to visually show where their kindergartens are. But as a Data Product Manager, you should see more than just a picture.
The hack: Geocoding addresses (converting "12 Rue de la Paix" to "48.86, 2.33") is difficult and usually costs money via APIs.
Hint: This map already contains the GPS coordinates of every nursery. Is there a way to download the underlying file behind a Google Map? (Keywords to research: KML, KMZ, XML parsing).
Why this matters: If you can extract this data, you have instant, free, 100% accurate geolocation for the entire network. Figure it out!
